parity_1     | Operating Options:
parity_1     |     --public-node
parity_1     |         Start Parity as a public web server. Account storage and transaction signing will be delegated to the UI.
parity_1     |
parity_1     |     --no-download
parity_1     |         Normally new releases will be downloaded ready for updating. This disables it. Not recommended.
parity_1     |
parity_1     |     --no-consensus
parity_1     |         Force the binary to run even if there are known issues regarding consensus. Not recommended.
parity_1     |
parity_1     |     --light
parity_1     |         Experimental: run in light client mode. Light clients synchronize a bare minimum of data and fetch necessary
parity_1     |         data on-demand from the network. Much lower in storage, potentially higher in bandwidth. Has no effect with
parity_1     |         subcommands.
parity_1     |
parity_1     |     --force-direct
parity_1     |         Run the originally installed version of Parity, ignoring any updates that have since been installed.
parity_1     |
parity_1     |     --mode=[MODE]
parity_1     |         Set the operating mode. MODE can be one of: last - Uses the last-used mode, active if none; active - Parity
parity_1     |         continuously syncs the chain; passive - Parity syncs initially, then sleeps and wakes regularly to resync; dark
parity_1     |         - Parity syncs only when the RPC is active; offline - Parity doesn't sync. (default: last)
parity_1     |
parity_1     |     --mode-timeout=[SECS]
parity_1     |         Specify the number of seconds before inactivity timeout occurs when mode is dark or passive (default: 300)
parity_1     |
parity_1     |     --mode-alarm=[SECS]
parity_1     |         Specify the number of seconds before auto sleep reawake timeout occurs when mode is passive (default: 3600)
parity_1     |
parity_1     |     --auto-update=[SET]
parity_1     |         Set a releases set to automatically update and install. SET can be one of: all - All updates in the our release
parity_1     |         track; critical - Only consensus/security updates; none - No updates will be auto-installed. (default: critical)
parity_1     |
parity_1     |     --release-track=[TRACK]
parity_1     |         Set which release track we should use for updates. TRACK can be one of: stable - Stable releases; beta - Beta
